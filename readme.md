# Traveling Salesman Problem Implemented in C

> *Using as few libraries as possible*

## Algorithm

I used different algorithms depending on the version. The Beta, v1.0, v2.0 all use a brute force approach. V3.0 uses a more sophisticated brute force approach called 
{beta, v1.0, v2.0} -> recursive naive brute force (does every possibility)
{v3.0} -> recursive backtracking approach (stop going down paths you know aren't the shortest)
{v4.0} -> dynamic  programming approach w/ bitwise operations (don't redo work and utilize fast speed of bitwise operations)

## Data Representation

Cities:
- Get inputted as coordinates (x, y)
- Once inputted, the program uses the coordinates of each city to calculate a distance matrix

## Different Versions

*I completed different versions of this program through GitHub branches. To look at the code for another version, change the branch.*
