/*

todo: be able to generate random cities (reject ones that are too close)
    * work in lib file, ran in test
be able to input cities (brain storm potential inputs)
    * file input
    * manually typing it in
     
     
problem: with 12 cities there is too much memory being used
two solutions:
    1 free memory that is no longer used in tsp helper
    2 make a memory efficient version of svm (more computation less caching)
